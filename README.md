# Logistic-Regression-with-two-categories-Cancer-Data
logistic Regression with two categories dependent variable and many independent variables
The project is about Diagnosis of Cancer and The factors which affects the diagnosis. The dependent variable is categoriacal with two categories yes and no. 
We started the project by importing the data and all necessary libraries. In seccond step, we isnpected the data and looked for duplicated and null values and none were found. In the third step, we changed the object data to numerical and also changed data type of the colimn, diagnosis. Then we visualised our data and checked for zeros and ones using value counts and bar chart. In fourth step, we specified our dependent variable "y" and independent variables"x". We also added one extra step and that was using standard scaler to transform the values as it was required in the data. In fiftth step, we split the data into test and train data and in sixth step we trained our model and predicted our values. In the seventh step, we found out intecept and coef of the model. In step 8th,we interpreted our results and in the last step we evaluated the model and score of 0.98 showed that it is an excellent model.
